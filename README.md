# PS132B-Machine Learning For Social Scientists 


## 1. Overview 

Social scientists and policymakers increasingly use large quantities of data to make decisions and test theories. For example, political campaigns use surveys, marketing data, and previous voting history to optimally target get out the vote drives. Governments deploy predictive algorithms in an attempt to optimize public policy processes and decisions. And political scientists use massive new data sets to measure the extent of partisan polarization in Congress, the sources and consequences of media bias, and the prevalence of discrimination in the workplace. Each of these examples, and many others, make use of statistical and algorithmic tools that distill large quantities of raw data into useful quantities of interest.


### 1.1 Objectives 

This course introduces techniques to collect, analyze, and utilize large collections of data for social science inferences. The ultimate goal of the course is to introduce students to modern machine learning techniques and provide the skills necessary to apply the methods widely. In achieving this ultimate goal, students will also:

1. Learn about core concepts in machine learning and statistics, developing skills that are transferable to other types of data and inference problems.

2. Develop their programming abilities in R.

3. Be introduced to substantive problems and participate in challenges applying the techniques from the course.
