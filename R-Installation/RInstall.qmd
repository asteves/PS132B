## Installing R

Go to <https://cloud.r-project.org/>. You want to download the latest version of R (4.2.2).

-   If you are using a Mac, click "Download R for macOS" and then select the right version of R. You will need to select the version corresponding to your specific version of macOS, as well as whether you have an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac.

-   If you are using Windows, click "Download R for Windows", then click "base", and click the download link.

-   If you are using Linux, click on the link corresponding to your Linux distribution, and then follow the instructions.

Once downloaded, open up the installer like any other piece of software and follow the instructions to install.

## Installing RStudio

Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download>

Download RStudio for your system. This should be as simple as clicking the button that looks like this (I have a Mac).

You do not need to install R again. Open the software installer once it finishes downloading and follow instructions.

## Open RStudio

It will look something like this when opened

## Install Packages (typing code way)

For future reference, you can always install packages by using the `install.packages()` function. Here is an example of what that looks like. You only ever have to install a package once.

## Creating an RMarkdown File

You'll see an output that looks something like this. Click the Knit button. Save the file to a directory with an appropriate name. Keep the .Rmd extension. The result once R finishes will be a pdf document.
